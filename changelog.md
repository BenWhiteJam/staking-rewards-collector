# Changelog
## Version 1.7.0
* Changed format of the account-level csv-outputs. We switched from a "per-day" format to a "per-payout" format to get more granular information. (thanks to rphmeier)
* Added the EventID of each staking reward to the csv-outputs.
* Fixed a small bug with timestamps and a function that lead the script to try to access unavailable prices leading to a "price undefined" error.
## Version 1.6.3
* It is now possible to add a subscan API key to skip call rate limits. If you do not have a key, just leave empty.
* More supported networks (edgeware, crab, and darwinia)
* Small bugfix with creation of output folder.
## Version 1.6.2
* Some code refactoring and under-the-hood improvements to make it easier to add additional networks in the future. (thanks to joepetrowski)
* Fixed bug that caused issues when creating a custom-named output folder.
## Version 1.6.1
* Added Centrifuge support (thanks to lucasvo)
* Added adjustable destination for output files. If not otherwise stated, files will be put into `/out`folder.
* Added KILT support. Note, that KILT seems to have a lot of individual payouts which can substantially increase the time that the script is running and increases the risk of API-timeouts.
## Version 1.6.0
* Added a new "Overview.csv" output that sums up all accounts into one file and shows the amount of tokens and the respective sum in the defined currency.
* Added new terminal output layout to account for increasing number of supported networks.
* Added support for Astar addresses.
* Added note about data sources in output files.
* Fixed: If a user requested price data for a network when no prices were available, the gathering of prices was wrongly turned off for all addresses that came after.
* Fixed: Ticker in rewards column of every chain except Polkadot indicated "KSM" instead of using correct ticker. This did not have any influence on the correct data.
* Fixed: Ticker in volume column indicated "DOT" or "KSM" but is provided in the requested price currency. This did not have any influence on the correct data.
## Version 1.5.2
* Added support to parse Shiden staking rewards. The goal is long-term to add more and more parachains. 
## Version 1.5.1
* Added support to parse Moonbeam staking rewards. The goal is long-term to add more and more parachains. 
* Updated donation addresses.
## Version 1.5.0
* Added support to parse Moonriver staking rewards. The goal is long-term to add more and more parachains. 
* Added new "network" field in userInput.json.
## Version 1.4.6
* Upgraded to new Subscan API standard.
* Added a small delay to avoid triggering API rate limit
## Version 1.4.5
* Added sum of fiat value in console output (based on daily prices).
## Version 1.4.4
* Fix: Slashes are not collected anymore.
## Version 1.4.3
* Subscan's API occasionally returns gibberish, added a loop to try again in such a case to improve UX.
* Output files will now not be written for accounts that did not receive rewards.
## Version 1.4.2
* Added more info on which address did never receive any staking rewards.
* Script does not terminate if one address did not receive any rewards.
* Removed Tax variables.
## Version 1.4.1
* Added link to a tutorial to the README.
* Script now does not terminate if one of the addresses did not receive any rewards in the specified time period.
* Coingecko provides fiat prices with many decimals, which is not sensible to use in the output files. Fiat price of tokens will now be rounded to two decimals.
* Changed `priceData` flag to `true` and `false` for consistency.
* Changed `initialInvestment` to `startBalance` to more accurately reflect the meaning.
## Version 1.4
Huge QoL improvement!
* Specify as many addresses as you want in the userInput.json.
* You can now also give your addresses a name.
* Removed network-specifier. The script now automatically detects which network the address is from (for Kusama/Polkadot).
* Added `exportOutput`: You can now specify if the output files should be generated or if you wish to just see your total staked amount in the terminal.

## Version 1.3
* Updated the API call such which gathers all price data with a single call. This significantly improves runtime and avoids throttle issues.
* Removed some rounding for non-Fiat values to give a accurate result.
* Fixed a bug where the USD price was used instead of other currencies.
* There is a very rare error when trying to parse the `stakingObject`. This resolves by simply running the script again. Added a note to ask the user to run the script again.
   
## Version 1.21
* Added GBP currency support.
* Included daily volume in output files.

## Version 1.2
* Removed the restriction that priceData must be available for all days within the specified time window. Now the user can request price data for any time period and the script will only populate prices where it is available and return a price of 0 where it is not.
* Bugfix: There was another case (accounts with many payouts), where the loop prematurely ended and did not show all staking rewards.
* Bugfix: There was one more day available of priceData from CoinGecko. This day is now included.
* CoinGecko's support told me that the *actual* request limit is 60/minute. I adjusted the parameters, which hopefully fixes request limit throttles.
* Included an info text how many requests are left and approx. runtime of the script.
* Adjusted `README.md` to illustrate the changes of v1.2.

## Version 1.1
* Bugfix: In some special combinations of `start`and `end`and paid rewards, it could lead to a premature termination of the addStakingData loop and not finding rewards.
* Bugfix: The script would parse one day less than in `end` specified. 
* CoinGecko limits API requests to 100 per minute. In some cases it seems that even waiting 80 seconds is not enough and the API returns a throttle warning. To counter this issue, a new variable `sleepTimer` is added to `config/userInput.json`. It specifies how long (in seconds) the script should idle before making an new request.
* Added suggestion to increase `sleepTime` if user experiences throttled API requests.
* Updated `README.md` to incorporate these changes and added a troubleshooting section.
